    <!--Shape-->

    <!--Material allows theming of a component’s shape through the customization of corner -->
    <!--style and radius size. To systematically apply shape throughout your app, it helps to -->
    <!--understand that components are categorized by size, grouped into categories of small, -->
    <!--medium and large. Each component size group can be themed by overriding the Material -->
    <!--Components attributes ?shapeAppearanceSmallComponent, ?shapeAppearanceMediumComponent -->
    <!--and ?shapeAppearanceLargeComponent in your app's theme. Those attributes are already -->
    <!--defined as default styles overridden for you in themes.xml and point to the styles in -->
    <!--this file.-->

    <!--Experiment with ShapeAppearance properties such as cornerFamily (either ‘cut’ or -->
    <!--‘rounded’) and corner size. Alternatively, customize each ShapeAppearance on a -->
    <!--per-corner basis with cornerFamilyTopLeft, cornerFamilyTopRight, cornerFamilyBottomLeft, -->
    <!--cornerFamilyBottomRight and cornerSizeTopRight, cornerSizeTopLeft, cornerSizeBottomLeft -->
    <!--and cornerSizeBottomRight.-->

    <!--Shape Appearance for small components like chips, buttons, text fields and FABs-->
    <style name="ShapeAppearance.Everyday.SmallComponent" parent="ShapeAppearance.MaterialComponents.SmallComponent">
        <!--Your custom shape here-->
    </style>

    <!--Shape Appearance for medium components like cards, alert dialogs-->
    <style name="ShapeAppearance.Everyday.MediumComponent" parent="ShapeAppearance.MaterialComponents.MediumComponent">
        <item name="cornerFamily">rounded</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeTopLeft">8dp</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeTopRight">8dp</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeBottomLeft">8dp</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeBottomRight">8dp</item>
    </style>

    <!--Shape Appearance for large components like side and bottom navigation drawers-->
    <style name="ShapeAppearance.Everyday.LargeComponent" parent="ShapeAppearance.MaterialComponents.LargeComponent">
        <item name="cornerFamily">rounded</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeTopLeft">16dp</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeTopRight">16dp</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeBottomLeft">0dp</item>
        <item name="cornerSizeBottomRight">0dp</item>
    </style>
