- [] check arch still conforms to updated standards
- [] fix and update tests to conform to updated standards
- [] check if possible to set github actions up, have some kind of simple CI/CD running maybe?
- [] build launch icon from rewards assets
- [] find info on building optional feature: rewards mechanism and statistics will only be added as a feature later, in order to be able to build a working version faster
