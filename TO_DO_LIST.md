# EVERYDAY TODO BUCKET LIST

- [x] fix bug on vectorDrawable color => android:fillColor="?attr/colorOnPrimary" works on all others vectors, but crashes on this one
- [x] check arch still conforms to updated standards
- [x] chek and update, then insert copyright license mention
- [ ] fix and update tests to conform to updated standards
  - [x] locale module
  - [x] repositories module
  - [x] commons module -> write tests on SharedPrefsHelper
- [x] fix Jacoco error log at each app launch
- [x] home activity is launched twice at startup
- [ ] find a cleaner way to handle duration in BottomDialogDismissibleSpinnersDurationAndConfirm
- [ ] find some way to automate code formatting in a customizable way (ie set else to new line etc.) ktlint looks good, but does not follow rules set in editorconfig, need to write custom Ruleset
- [ ] find info on building optional feature: rewards mechanism and statistics will only be added as a feature later, in order to be able to build a working version faster => we may have to split the screens module up to dissociate "bonus" features from "core" features, question is where to put the associated models, dto, repos, if not in the corresponding modules?
- [ ] check if possible to set github actions up, have some kind of simple CI/CD running maybe? (see: https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/github-actions-for-android-developers-6b54c8a32f55)
- [ ] build launch icon from rewards assets, insert as vector adaptative icon (see https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/vectordrawable-adaptive-icons-3fed3d3205b5)
- [ ] update file access method for import/export (Storage Access Framework API aka Scoped Storage). As I understand it for now, since the access we need is for non-media files (csv), we will have to use the system file picker, which is already  planned for the import, and is actually a better way for the export than the present version with a dialog showing the export file location. Maybe some difficulties regarding compatibility with older versions of android. (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnJ3amzJM94 and https://medium.com/swlh/sample-for-android-storage-access-framework-aka-scoped-storage-for-basic-use-cases-3ee4fee404fc)
